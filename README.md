Graduating in 2023 with a MSc in Computer Science specialised in Artificial Intelligence from Sorbonne University.

Areas of expertise: 

 - **Machine Learning** - supervised, unsupervised, (deep) reinforcement learning
 - **Multi-Agent Systems** - planning, consensus dynamics, distributed constraint optimisation, BDI
 - **Decision Support** - multiple-criteria and collective decision-making, choice under uncertainty, computational social choice
 - **Operations Research** - linear programming, path-finding algorithms, genetic algorithms, branch and bound, scheduling
 - **Human-Computer Interaction** - user-centered design, user modeling, tracing, adaptive systems, game design, VR
 - **Robotics** - subsomption architectures, evolutionary algorithms, swarm robotics

Interested in applying my knowledge:

 - for education and science communication, in particular for K-12 audiences, 
 - for citizen-science initiatives,
 - to tackle the climate and biodiversity crises,
 - to raise awareness about mental health issues, and
 - to fight against discrimination of all forms.
